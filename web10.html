	"Four Golden Rules of UI Design" is a concept that guides high-level web interface
	design to be more usable. The below article explain how web designers can use these
	basic rules to enhance their web designs to improve user experience.

	The UI design principles are:

	1. Place users in control of the interface:

		You should not make your users lost on your website. Another thing that you can
		do to place users in control is by providing feedback. Feedback is typically 
		associated with points of action--for every user action, the system should show
		a meaningful, clear reaction. A system with feedback for every action helps users
		achieve their goals without a doubt.

	2. Make it comfortable to interact with a product:

		There is a saying, "Less is more". You can adapt this concept to your design as 
		well. Don't overload a webpage with so many items. Keep it simple, and 
		functional. Also, keep simple and easy-to-understand words. Don't put complicated
		text or images unnecessarily. 

	3. Reduce cognitive load
		
		Your website should not demand a lot of thinking processes from its users. 
		Inherently, your website should be appealing for users and it should attract 
		more users. Try to use commonly known words and icons across your website.

	4. Make user interfaces consistent 

		Suppose you design a website with multiple web pages. There, you need to use the 
		same color theme, and look and feel. If you put paragraph text in black color on 
		one page, and another page if you use red for your paragraph texts, it might 
		violate the consistency. All your web pages should look similar in theme, color,
		and behaviors. It's not just colors, font size, font faces, button styles, margin
		spaces, everything need to be consistent across all pages.
