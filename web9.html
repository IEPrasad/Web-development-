	AJAX 

		** AJAX is a developer's dream, because you can:

			:: Read data from a web server - after a web page has loaded 
			:: Upload a web page without reloading the page 
			:: Send data to a web server - in the background 

	RestAPI 

		** A Rest API (also known as RESTful API) is an application programming interface
		(API or web API) that confirms to the constraints of REST architectural style and
		allows for interaction with RESTful web services.
		REST stand for representational state transfer and was created by computer 
		scientist Roy Fielding 



 
	 		AJAX 

	 			** AJAX = Asynchronous JavaScript and XML.
	 			** AJAX is not a programming language.

	 			** AJAX just uses a combination below two

	 				:: A browser built-in XMLHttpRequest object.
	 				:: JavaScript and HTML DOM.



	 	------Browser-------- 								--------server-------
		An event occurs...										

		* Create an 		--------> Internet ------->      ** process HTTpRequest 
		HTMLHTTpRequest  										
															 ** create a response and 
		* Send HTTpRequest										send data back to the 
																browser

								** Process the returned 	<-------Internet
								   data using JavaScript 

								** Update page content 




 
 			Rest APIs 

 				** Rest APIs provide a flexible, lightweight way to integrate 
 				applications, and have emerged a the most common method for 
 				connecting components in microservices architectures 





 		AJAX and Rest APIs 

 				** You can use AJAX to send RESTful requests.

 				** The XMLHTTpRequest object is used to exchange data 
 					with a server

 				1. xhttp.open("GET", "ajax_info.txt", true);
 				2. xhttp.send();
