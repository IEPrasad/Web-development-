	** The client-Server Architecture

			** Modern application runs on the client-server architecture.
			
			** This architecture separates applications software into two categories.
					** Servers 
					** Clients

			** The client and server application can be hosted on the same machine but 
				it's more efficient and effective when the client and server 
				applications are hosted and executed on the different machine connected 
				via a network.

		JavaScript Web application hosting 

			** A generic JavaScript application below 
			
			** Front-end: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
			** Back-end: JavaScript running on a Node.js server.

		Firebase Hosting 

			** Firebase Hosting is built for the modern web developer. Websites and apps 
			are more powerful than ever with the rise of front-end JavaScript frameworks 
			like Angular and static generator tools like Jekyll.

			** Whether you are developing a simple app landing page or a complex 
			Progressive Web App (PWA), Hosting gives you the infrastructure, features,
			and tooling tailored to developing and managing websites and apps.

		Introduction to Cloud Server

		** Cloud servers are basically virtual servers that run within a cloud computing
		environment. There are various benefits to hosting and deploying your
		application on the cloud. They are:

				* Economically efficient.
				
				* You have the freedom to modify the server software to your needs.
				
				* Cloud servers scale very well.

				* Stability and security.


		** In fact, many companies have moved their infrastructure to the cloud in order
		to reduce cost and complexity.it's a great option for small, mid-sized, and
		enterprise scale businesses. If you write a lot of tutorials and do POCs 
		(Proof-of-concepts) like me, it's also a great choice for you!

		** A generic JavaScript application involves a:

				** Front-end: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. A couple of CSS frameworks 
				that can be used the front end are:

				---> Bootstrap: The most popular CSS framework in the world 

				---> Bulma: A modern CSS framework based on Flexbox

				---> Tailwind: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development

		** A couple of JavaScript frameworks that can be used on the front end are:

				---> React
				---> Vue
				---> Angular
				---> Preact
				---> Polymer
				---> Svelte
				---> Mithril


		** Back-end: JavaScript running on a Node.js server. Some frameworks that
		cant be used on the back end are:

				>> Express: Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js.
				
				>> Hapi: Rich framework for building applications and services.
				
				>> Koa: Next generation web framework for Node.js.

				>> Sails: Realtime MVC framework for Node.js.

		** Examples of Databases that can be used are:

				>> MongoDB

				>> MySQL

				>> PostgreSQL
