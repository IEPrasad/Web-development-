					** TypeScript influence 

		** TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript with design-time 
			Support for type safety and tooling 

		** TypeScript primarily provides statics typing, classes and interfaces.

				Ngmodules collect related code into functional sets.

			** An Angular applications is defined by a set of Ngmodules. An application
